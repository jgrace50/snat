Changes in SecureCRT 8.0.1 (Official) -- April 26, 2016
-------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - The color of the icons in the button bar can be configured, allowing
    buttons to be color coded.  This feature was inadvertently omitted
    from the Beta 1 history.

Changes:

  - Pressing ALT+M will open the Session Manager if it's hidden.
  - Pressing ALT+I will display the Session Manager if it's hidden and
    put focus in the filter bar.
  - Pressing ALT+G on Windows and Linux or ALT+COMMAND+G on the Mac will
    open the Command window if it's not already open.
  - Added the ability to map the Command window option to send characters
    immediately (MENU_TOGGLE_SEND_CHARACTERS_IMMEDIATELY) to a key or
    button.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when importing settings from settings that were
    exported from SecureCRT 8.0 if the settings contained a button bar.
  - The fallback mechanism for public-key authentication did not work
    correctly and authentication failed rather than prompting for the
    username and public key.
  - If a large keyword highlighting list that included regular
    expressions was used for a session containing a large scrollback
    buffer, session output could be very slow.
  - The Xterm escape sequence to change the title was not being honored.
  - Pressing ALT+B opened the Session Manager, but did not connect the
    selected session(s).
  - If the session font was changed before connecting, the old font
    settings were used when the session was connected.
  - If SecureCRT did not open any sessions on startup and auto-hide was
    on for the Session Manager, the Session Manager stayed open.
  - Fixed a memory leak that occurred when ECDSA keys were used.
  - Windows: If a tabbed session was closed or disconnected while it was
    being dragged to a new tab group, SecureCRT could crash.
  - Windows: After connecting to a session using the Session Manager,
    focus remained in the Session Manager instead of moving to the
    session.
  - Mac/Linux: SecureCRT crashed when attempting to use the Public Key
    Assistant.
  - Mac: SecureCRT could crash if accessibility options were on and the
    Session Options dialog was opened several times in rapid succession
    from the toolbar or the Cancel button was pressed while tabbing
    through options in the Session Options dialog.
  - Mac: If auto-hide was on for the Session Manager, pressing COMMAND+I
    did not move focus from the session tree to the session filter box.

  - Zmodem uploads of large files (e.g., 30 MB) could hang.
  - If the configuration paths were set up so that a personal data
    folder was being used and the configuration folder was read-only,
    settings could not be saved in the personal data folder even
    though it was writable.
  - If the configuration paths were set up so that a personal data
    folder was being used and the configuration folder was read-only,
    attempting to merge the configuration data failed and the personal

    that TLS is supported.

    the background for the terminal area when SecureCRT starts and
    no sessions are connected.

    Session Manager, it appeared to be activated, but clicking in the
    Session Manager did nothing.

    sessions in tabs" were off and the SecureCRT window contained a
    disconnected tab, when a new session was connected, it was opened
    in a new tab.

    edited or deleted.  The name "New..." is no longer allowed.

    .pfx file was used as the public key.

    PKCS #11 public-key authentication using the ActivClient DLL, the
    connection failed due to an error creating the signature during
    public-key authentication.
  - Windows: On a high-DPI (e.g., 4k) monitor, font scaling and session
    zooming did not work correctly.

    right clicked.
  - Mac: When using an Apple Magic Mouse, doing a side-swipe on the mouse
    after or while double clicking caused focus to be put in the Session
    Manager.
  - Mac: If the SecureCRT window was maximized after connecting to a
    session and the toolbar was hidden, the SecureCRT window resized
    and changed position.  Then if the SecureCRT was maximized again
    and the same session was connected again or closed, the SecureCRT
    window resized and changed position again.
